- choose either pom or cinna ✅
- hunger bar, stamina/play bar, cleanliness bar, happiness bar ✅
- pet function to increase happiness ✅
- shop to buy food ✅
- mini games to earn coins ✅
- for image pressed, do function mousePressed, if mouseX === picX and mouseY === picY, etc. ✅



make cinna and pom as classes(?)/objects so we can do the x and y
and change the images easily 
^ so like cinna = {eat, idle, etc} and when we do code we do like food(pet){
image(pet.eat) ?? } if that makes sense

to do >
- add in other mini games 
- get coins from mini games ✅
- create the shop to buy food ✅
- feed ur pet function ✅
- we'd probably need like an inventory thing ✅
-pet function ✅
- sleep ✅
- clean ✅

add in if we got nothing left to do >
-music, sfx basically ✅
-cuter images✅
-find a way to make pom an option ✅
-give cinna and pom different behaviors / fav foods
-have ur pet request a specific food, refuse to eat unless it is that one
-tutorial text boxes?
-more cars for frogger game maybe make them face the direction they're going ✅
-loop music

-clean up poop function ✅


bugs >
-when gameIsOver but you press the mouse, you just keep getting coins lol✅
-snake doesn't work bc frogger uses arrows also ✅

not bugs but things to note for tmrw
-make sure no images are compressed
-pomlove and cinnasleep dont loop
-framerate changes to 10 in snake and changes back to 60 when gameIsOver but not when home is pressed

setInterval creates the intervals beforehand right ?? and then
when the minigames are playing its creating poop intervals 
in the background ??? and then when youre back on the homescreen
its trying to send all the poops it made and its so fast ???
